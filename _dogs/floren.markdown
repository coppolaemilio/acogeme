WE MADE IT!!!! 
SHE IS GOOD TO GO FOR OPERATION AND SAFE IN RESIDENCE FOR ONE MORE MONTH.
She is still on meds for her wound to heal and she still limps, but she is expected to fully recover in time.
THANK YOU SO MUCH Eva Quirbach for your big, life saving, kind donation, and also Alison Dunstan and Monika Koestler for your contributions <3
